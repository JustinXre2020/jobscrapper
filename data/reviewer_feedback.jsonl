The Analyzer states 'Seniority Level is 'principal' (not entry-level) despite 'Years Experience Required: None'.' However, the structured data shows Seniority Level is 'principal' (which is clearly not entry-level) AND Years Experience Required is 'None' - this is logically consistent. The Analyzer incorrectly claims this is a contradiction. The correct evaluation should be entry_level: False (which matches the Analyzer's conclusion but for the wrong reason). The Analyzer's reasoning is flawed because 'Years Experience Required: None' does not contradict 'principal' seniority level - principal roles can exist without minimum experience requirements. The Analyzer should have noted that 'principal' seniority level inherently means this is not an entry-level position regardless of experience requirements."}
